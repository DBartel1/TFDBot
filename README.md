This bot was created in order to add features that were not in the game "The First Descendant" at the time of creation. The main purpose of the bot was to allow the user to view other player's builds in the game and other information about them. This is done by using Nexon's (the developer of TFD) API. The bot is run through Discord and can be put in any Discord server the user wants provided you have a developer tool API key.
